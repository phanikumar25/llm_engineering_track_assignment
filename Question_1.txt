Question: Can algorithms like SMOTE/ROSE which synthesize new examples from the training data be called Generative AI?


Answer  : No, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and ROSE (Random Over-Sampling Examples) should not be classified as Generative AI. These techniques are data augmentation methods aimed at addressing class imbalance by synthesizing new examples from existing training data. SMOTE generates synthetic samples by interpolating between similar instances within the minority class in the feature space, while ROSE creates new data points by adding random noise to existing samples. These methods primarily enhance the dataset's variety for better model training in classification tasks using straightforward algorithms. In contrast, Generative AI involves more complex models that learn the underlying distribution of data to produce entirely new and diverse instances. These advanced models often employ techniques like adversarial training or sophisticated probabilistic modeling to generate high-quality outputs across different domains such as images, text, and audio.
